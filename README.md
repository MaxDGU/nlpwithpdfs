(Non-restricted/public) part of the proprietary code I built for a large US bank as a consultant. Mines PDF's with PDFPlumber to extract word frequencies, unigram, bigram, and trigram counts. Implemented NLP methods on financial documents (with capability for all PDF documents) like smoothed trigram probability, sentence log probability, perplexity.
