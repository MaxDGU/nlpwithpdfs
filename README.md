# nlpwithpdfs
(Non-restricted) part of the code I built for a large US bank for my current position. Mines PDF's with PDFPlumber to extract word frequencies, unigram, bigram, and trigram counts. Implemented NLP methods on financial documents (with capability for all PDF documents) like smoothed trigram probability, sentence log probability, perplexity.
